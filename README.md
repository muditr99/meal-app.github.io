# Meal App Using Vanilla Javascript

This is a repository for Meal App Developed using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS.


## Problem Statement

Create an Meal App. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).
## Features Required

1) Home Page

-> Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).

-> Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).

-> On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)


2) Meal Detail Page

-> Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

3) My favourite meals Page

-> Display a list of all the favourite meals.

-> Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).

-> Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
